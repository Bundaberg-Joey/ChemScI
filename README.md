# ChemSci
![Build Status](https://github.com/Bundaberg-Joey/ChemScI/workflows/ChemScI/badge.svg)

## Goals
* Provide a consistent interface for the featurisation of molecules or other chemical systems for informatics studies
* Allow for these featurisations to be easily saved to a wide variety of formats
* Allow for novel featurisations to easily be incorporated / implemented from literature within minimal boiler plate required from contributing authors

ChemSci is designed to facilitate an entirely modular approach to chemical featurisation, where the featurisation of a chemical system does not assume it originates from a SMILES string etc.
This prevents commonly used tools from being subtly hard-coded into the ChemSci and ensures a flexible API is maintained.

Through providing a consistent API, it is hoped that newly developed featurisations for cheminformatics can be readily incorporated and hence provide easy access to the informatics community.


## TODO
### Features
1. Try and add a literature example as a demo for novel incorporation (if code + suitable license)
2. Use pubchem to really demonstrate non hard coded example
### Development
3. Get some tests written
